  <p>So, here is the deal:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick. (A French Fry Cutter makes this easier.)</li>

    <li> Soak them cold in water for at least an hour or overnight. (Longer = crispier fries)</li>

    <li> Rinse them twice with cold water and pat the completely dry.></li>

    <li> Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6 minutes. Don’t overcrowd them by placing too many in at a time, they won’t be as crispy. Use a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel.</li>

    <li> Increase heat to 400 degrees. Fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>

    <li> Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt. Serve with ketchup!</li>
  </ol>
